This repository contains all files and documentation related to our SECOM Fault Detection project. The SECOM dataset (from the UCI Machine Learning Repository) includes sensor readings from semiconductor manufacturing, alongside a binary indicator of whether a product is faulty.

We aim to build a predictive model that detects potential manufacturing faults early, helping reduce costly errors and improve production efficiency.
